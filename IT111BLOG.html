            <p>In this lesson, I learned that computing offers a wide range of professions 
              and career opportunities. From software development to data analysis, there are 
              numerous paths one can take in the field of computing. Additionally, I discovered that 
              these careers often emphasises the importance of continuously updating and expanding my 
              knowledge in order to stay competitive in this rapidly evolving field. Overall, this lesson has
              sparked my interest and motivation to explore different areas within computing and pursue a career
              that aligns with my skills and interests. </p>

            <p>In this Lesson 2, I learned that computer security is the practice of protecting computer systems
              and data from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. 
              It involves implementing various measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption, to 
              safeguard against potential threats. Additionally, understanding the importance of strong passwords and regularly
              updating software are crucial aspects of maintaining computer security. </p>

                <p>In lesson Zeroth Generation, this refers to the earliest forms of computer technology that existed before 
                  the first generation of computers. These early computers were typically large and used vacuum tubes for processing data. 
                  They were often limited in terms of memory and processing power, but they laid the foundation for future advancements in computing technology. 
                  This helped me to know the history and evolution of computers and how far we have come in terms of size, speed, and capabilities. It's fascinating to see
                   how these early machines paved the way for the modern devices we use today, shaping the entire field of computer science. </p>

                        <p>In this lesson about basic HTML and CSS, I learned that HTML and CSS are two fundamental languages
                           used for creating and styling web pages. HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is responsible for the structure
                          and organization of content on a webpage, while CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to control the presentation and layout of that content, 
                          These languages work together to create visually appealing and functional websites.This lesson helped me understand how to use HTML tags to create headings,
                          paragraphs, lists, and links. I also learned how to use CSS properties to change the font, colour, and size of text, as well as how to add background colours and images 
                          to elements on a webpage. Overall, this lesson provided me with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, and I am excited to continue learning and exploring these languages further. </p>

                        <p>This one of  my output that challenged me the most,  making our own wireframe because
                          it required a deep understanding of the project's objectives and user needs. Additionally, 
                          creating a wireframe allowed us to visualise the layout and structure of the website or application, ensuring 
                          a seamless user experience. Creating a website is also challenging for me because it involves coding and designing
                          elements that are visually appealing and functional. However, the satisfaction of seeing the final product come to life and
                          knowing that it will enhance user interactions makes it all worth it,</p>
